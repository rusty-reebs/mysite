Hi, I'm Russell. I am a self-taught developer from Canada, currently living in Tbilisi, Georgia ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ª. I am following [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) curriculum to learn web development.

My developer career intentions are to:

* work fully remote,
* be part of a fun and dynamic team,
* contribute to meaningful projects,
* continuously advance my programming skills and become better every day.

What I bring to the table:

* dependability,
* open communication,
* the ability to compromise,
* the willingness to learn.
