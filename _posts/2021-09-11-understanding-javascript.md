I was just reflecting on how much I've learned. Things have been *much* easier now than when I began. ðŸ˜… NGL, the first few months were **tough**. But through the projects I've coded, I've gained a much better understanding of concepts like how to pass parameters, invoke functions, and organize code.  

I took a break from the To-Do List app, (it's going to be **epic** BTW) and I just finished a fun slideshow mini-project. One of the most difficult parts was setting up the timing interval. My plan envisioned a timer to begin on initialization, then to be reset when the user clicked a forward, back, or index circle icon. This was easier said than done! But I figured it out, mostly thanks to perseverence and the docs. You can check it out [here](https://rusty-reebs.github.io/slideshow/). Ciao!
