I think my brain has gone to mush today. 🧠 The last few days, I've been making good progress with my [Tic-Tac-Toe project](github.com/rusty-reebs/tic-tac-toe) and our game jam. I'm feeling much more confident with coding and syntaxes. But today I'm stuck on logic. I can't seem to make sense of how to make bigger picture stuff work. It's frustrating. Think it's time to call it a day.
