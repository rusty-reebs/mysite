I'm ready! After investing over 1000 hours in learning front-end JavaScript, I've built a nice [portfolio](/projects/) to demonstrate my skills and what I have to offer. Today I'm writing my resume and cover letter and I'll start applying for remote developer positions this week.  ðŸ˜ƒ   

I also plan to continue learning back-end tech like Node.js and Express.js with [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) to round out my skills as a full stack developer.&nbsp; ðŸ™Œ
