I'm happy to report that I accepted my first full stack web developer position and have been working remotely full time for almost two months! ü§©üéâ I'm part of a small team that is building version 3.0 of a medical records portal. We're coding it in React/Next.js, Express, and MongoDB. It's basically the exact tech stack that I learned in [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com), so I'm pretty stoked about that.

The learning curve has been steep so far and I've been exposed to a lot of complexity. But it's going well and I'm looking forward to meeting all of the challenges head-on. Cheers! üçª
