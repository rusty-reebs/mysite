I finished up a fun ☀️ [weather app](https://rusty-reebs.github.io/weather-app/) yesterday! I wrote asynchronous JavaScript functions as well as `fetch`, `await`, `try`, and `catch` to make it all work.

I decided to render the current date and time for the chosen location. This presented some challenges in plain JavaScript! 😅 I used the `Date` object and methods but it also required some additional math, processing, and manipulating! I'm really happy with how the whole app turned out, including the CSS styling. 🤩

Something that I'm finding more difficult as the projects get more complex is organizing my code. I'm currently reading *Clean Code* by Robert Martin for an online book club I'm in. I've already taken away lots of great tips that I'm incorporating into my code.

Tomorrow I'm diving into TDD -- Test Driven Development -- with Jest. ✌️
