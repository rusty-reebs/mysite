title:  "Reactions to React"

I started learning ‚öõÔ∏è [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) recently. It's a pretty big deal in the modern web development scene! It **is** pretty cool, I like the idea of components and their reusability. Things start to come together fast! Definitely a nice change from all of the intensive DOM manipulation in plain JavaScript. (Re: my [To-Do List app](https://github.com/rusty-reebs/to-do-list) üòÖ).  

*Although*, it did take me a bit to wrap my head around the syntax and using `props` and `state`, especially with class components and `this`. I've found using functional components to be a lot more straightforward and intuitive. The React docs are excellent -- very helpful and easy to follow. I'm glad that I have strong JavaScript and HTML bases to build from, otherwise I think I'd be up the creek.  

I also found this podcast episode, [Getting hooked on React](https://changelog.com/jsparty/186), to be helpful for cementing some of the concepts and lingo in my head.

Tomorrow I'll start on another sweet project for my portfolio, an online store with a shopping cart, written in React and plain CSS. Hmmm, what should we buy??
