👾 I'm participating in my first game jam! What's a [game jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam)? It's a team contest where the participants try to make a video game from scratch. This particular jam is being hosted by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) on [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/top-jam-1). The theme is **edutainment**, a combination of **education** and **entertainment**. We have three weeks to build a game for kids using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- manipulating the DOM.

My team has four members, including me. We are using Discord to communicate -- it's where we strategize, plan our roles, and problem solve together. I'm most excited about working on a remote team. We each have our own bit of work to do. Our code is stored in a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com), which we need to *clone* (copy) to our local computers, make our contributions, and then *push* (send back) to GitHub where it's merged with the rest of the team's code.

I'm stoked to be practicing more real-life skills used in web development. 😃 Stay tuned for updates! ✌️
