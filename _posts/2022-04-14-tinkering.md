After launching [worldschoolingpopups.com](https://worldschoolingpopups.com) in early March, I've been keeping busy revisiting some older portfolio projects and learning new tech. I'm in the process of rewriting my [restaurant page project](https://rusty-reebs.github.io/restaurant-page/) in ⚛️&nbsp;React and including a 📱&nbsp;mobile friendly design. And I dove into learning more about [Postman](https://postman.com) and API documentation, too.

I'm tinkering around with [worldschoolingpopups.com](https://worldschoolingpopups.com). Rather than allowing users to create accounts and event listings, I put together an Admin page to manage the data input in-house. So now the frontend page only consumes API data. It's been cool to see the Google Analytics web traffic increasing as more and more people visit the site. 😃

My plan is to build a few more example small-business websites to include in my portfolio. I think it will be fun to offer some small-project contract web development services. And I'm always thinking of larger personal projects that are useful for people. One of the best things about being a full-stack developer is being able to design something conceptually, write the code, and produce an amazing hand-crafted, finished product. 🙌
