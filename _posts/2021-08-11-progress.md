ğŸ™Œ Alright, I'm pretty stoked to be moving past my HTML/CSS/JS Tic-Tac-Toe project! You can play it [here](https://rusty-reebs.github.io/tic-tac-toe) on GitHub. I will say that I've developed **a lot** better understanding of all three of these languages since I began coding. Hello, parameters and callback functions?! Next I will be starting with JavaScript modules and using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) as a bundler. My next project will be a restaurant homepage. I'm thinking delicious Georgian ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡ª food => because I'm in Georgia! Mmmmm, can you say *khinkhali*? ğŸ˜‹ Stay tuned for the link!
