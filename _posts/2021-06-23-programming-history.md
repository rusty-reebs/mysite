Looking back, I admit that I was a bit of a computer nerd as a kid. I think I may have been obsessed with computers and computer games. I did a lot of programming, especially in elementary school. I subscribed to computer magazines like *PC Magazine* and *BYTE* and even went to some computer summer camps. My earliest computer experiences were with friends who had the VIC-20, the TRS-80, the Commodore 64, the Apple IIc, and the Commodore Amiga. My family later bought an IBM XT Compatible. Some of my favorite games were the quests series from Sierra, like *King's Quest*, *Space Quest*, and *Leisure Suit Larry*. ðŸ¤£

I recall doing a lot of programming in BASIC. I used to find books and magazines about BASIC at the library. Often there would be computer programs written line for line in them. I remember sitting at the computer in our basement, entering pages of code to create some rudimentary text-based game to play. It looked like this:

```
10 LET N=10
20 FOR I=1 TO N
30 PRINT "Hello, World!"
40 NEXT I
50 END
```

In high school, I took a few computer classes mostly just out of interest, not with the intention of a computer science career. Turbo Pascal seemed to be the flavor of the day back then. I also discovered the world of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS's) and forums around this time. I'll get into BBS's and the early days of the Netscape-dominated internet in a future post. When I was in college, I took another computer course in Turbo Pascal. But after that class, my computer programming interests and opportunities started to fade away... **until now.** ðŸ¤“
