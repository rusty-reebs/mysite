I'm trying to make time to code something everyday. Usually I have a project to work on but sometimes I don't want to think too hard so I'll just do a few coding exercises from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). 

I'm finding it difficult to work 30-35 hours a week in a demanding job, be with my family, and have the time and energy to work on coding.

But even a little progress is still progress. Things are starting to stick and make more sense. Yesterday I made some styling edits to my library project and I felt like I actually knew what I was doing. It's a good feeling. ðŸ˜Š
