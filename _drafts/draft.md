Job ready

I'm ready! After investing over 1000 hours in learning front-end JavaScript, I've built a nice portfolio to demonstrate my skills and what I have to offer. Today I'm writing my resume and cover letter and I'll start applying for remote developer positions this week. ðŸ˜ƒ I also plan to continue learning back-end tech with The Odin Project (https://theodinproject.com) to round out my skills as a full stack developer.
