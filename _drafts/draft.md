My Current Roadmap

I'm new to web development, but where am I going? Yes, I do have some idea. I'm following [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) curriculum, which focuses on full stack web development. I plan to complete the JavaScript track and projects and have practical skills in JS, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, and React. 

I'm very interested in Web 3.0, blockchain, dApps, and smart contracts. I feel that this part of the tech industry is just getting started and there will be many employment opportunities in the next decade. So, to branch out after The Odin Project, I want to look at Hardhat, ethers.js, and Solidity.

Hack-a-thons and Game Jams are other ways that I will look to build more skills and network with more developers. Right now, I'm focused on progressing through The Odin Project curriculum to get started. Cheers!


Tales from my programming past

Looking back, I can admit that I was a bit of a computer nerd as a kid. I was, to put it mildly, obsessed with computers and computer games. I did a lot of programming, especially in elementary school. I subscribed to computer magazines like PC Magazine and BYTE and even went to some computer summer camps. My earliest computer experiences were with friends who had the VIC-20, the TRS-80, the Commodore 64, the Apple IIc, and the Commodore Amiga. Our family had an IBM Compatible XT. Some of my favorite games were the quests series from Sierra, like King's Quest, Space Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry.

I recall doing a lot of programming in BASIC. I used to find books and magazines about BASIC at the library. Often there would be computer programs written line for line in them. I remember sitting at the computer in our basement, entering pages of code to create some rudimentary text-based game to play. It looked like this:

In high school, I took a few computer classes mostly just out of interest, not with the intention of a computer science career. Turbo Pascal seemed to be the flavor of the day back then. I discovered the world of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS's) and forums around this time. I'll get into BBS's and the early days of the Netscape-dominated internet in future post. When I was in college, I took another computer course in Turbo Pascal. But after that class, my computer programming interests and opportunities started to fade away... until now.
