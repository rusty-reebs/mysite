Tinkering

After launching [worldschoolingpopups.com](https://worldschoolingpopups.com) in early March, I've been keeping busy revisiting some older portfolio projects and learning new tech. I'm in the process of rewriting my restaurant page project in ‚öõÔ∏è&nbsp;React and including a üì±&nbsp;mobile friendly design. I dove into learning more about [Postman](https://postman.com) and API documentation, too.

I'm also tinkering around with [worldschoolingpopups.com](https://worldschoolingpopups.com). Rather than allowing users to create accounts and event listings, I put together an Admin page to manage the data input in-house. So now the frontend page only consumes API data. It's been cool to see the Google Analytics web traffic increasing as more and more people visit the site. üòÉ

I plan to build a few more example small-business websites to include in my portfolio. I think it will be fun to offer some small-project contract web development services. And I'm always thinking of larger personal projects that are useful for people. One of the best things about being a full-stack developer is being able to design something conceptually, write the code, and produce an amazing hand-crafted, finished product. üôå


Not REST-ing, building APIs

In between applying for jobs, I've been building a full stack, real world web application. üòÉ It's a worldwide listing of worldschooling pop ups, or events. *Wait, what's worldschooling?* You can read about it at [weareworldschoolers.org](https://weareworldschoolers.org/resources/what-is-worldschooling/). 

‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back to the app. It's built on a REST API-only backend, written with Node and Express. The frontend is coded in React. Users can see a listing of events, read details about events, and post their own pop up events. I've also incorporated the Google Maps API to locate the events globally and locally. Search features are also planned... the possibilties are endless! Here are a couple of sneak peek screenshots -- I plan to publish the site by the end of the month. The domain, which I bought for cheap at [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com), is [worldschoolingpopups.com](https://worldschoolingpopups.com).
