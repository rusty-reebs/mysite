Reactions to React

I've been learning ‚öõÔ∏è [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) recently. It's pretty cool, I like the idea of components and their reusability. Things start to come together fast! It's a nice change from all of the intensive DOM manipulation in plain JavaScript. (Re: my [To-Do List app üòÖ](https://github.com/rusty-reebs/to-do-list)).  

*Although*, it did take me a bit to wrap my head around using props and state, especially with class components and `this`. I've found using functional components to be a lot more straightforward and intuitive. I'm glad that I have good JavaScript and HTML bases to build from, otherwise I think I'd be up the creek.  

Tomorrow I'll start on another project for my portfolio, an online store with a shopping cart, written in React.



Today my a-ha! moment was learning that when we pass state as props, it literally is referenced as props in the code.




Array methods

findIndex and indexOf 



Having fun with APIs

I finished up a fun ‚òÄÔ∏è [weather app](https://rusty-reebs.github.io/weather-app/) yesterday! I wrote asynchronous JavaScript functions as well as `fetch`, `await`, `try`, and `catch` to make it all work.

I decided to render the current date and time for the chosen location. This presented some challenges in plain JavaScript! üòÖ I used the `Date` object and methods but it also required some additional math, processing, and manipulating! I'm really happy with how the whole app turned out, including the CSS styling. ü§©

Something that I'm finding more difficult as the projects get more complex is organizing my code. I'm currently reading *Clean Code* by Robert Martin for an online book club I'm in. I've already taken away lots of great tips that I'm incorporating into my code.

Tomorrow I'm diving into TDD -- Test Driven Development -- with Jest. ‚úåÔ∏è
